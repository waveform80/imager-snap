  Raspberry Pi Imager is an easy to use application for installing Raspberry Pi
  OS, or other operating systems, to an SD card ready to use with your
  Raspberry Pi.

  Usage is as simple as:

  1. Pick the Raspberry Pi board you want to use.

  2. Pick the operating system you want to write.

  3. Pick the storage you want to write it to (SD card, hard drive, SSD, etc.)

  4. Click "NEXT", confirm you wish to overwrite your storage and wait!

  The application also verifies that the operating system has been written
  correctly after writing has finished. With certain operating system images,
  the imager also supports customizing the first boot configuration (you will
  be prompted for more information after selecting "NEXT" in this case).
