# Snapcraft Desktop Helpers

The snapcraft desktop helpers project contains a number of tools to help you create snaps for desktop applications. For example, several environment variables and compatibility symlinks are setup in the [desktop-launch wrapper](https://github.com/ubuntu/snapcraft-desktop-helpers/blob/master/common/desktop-exports) to help ensure the snap can find needed files.

## How to use the desktop helpers

Go to the documentation on [snapping graphical applications](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/desktop-applications/13034) and follow the instructions for the GUI toolkit that your application uses.

> ℹ️ We are currently in the process of moving most of the functionality of the desktop helpers to [Snapcraft Extensions](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/snapcraft-extensions/13486). The extensions are much easier to use and contain many improvements, so it's advised to use an extension if one is available for the GUI toolkit that you use.
